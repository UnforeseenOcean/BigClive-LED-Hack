Note: I'm aware of the issue where the "Input Voltage" selection doesn't appear correctly, this seems to be an issue with Materialize. Simply click on "Calculate" to make it appear correctly.

If you want to calculate the wattage based on the resistor you'll be adding, simply put two identical value (e.g. 100 ohms) in both fields.
